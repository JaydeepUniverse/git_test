Product Team Responsibilities (Day-to-Day Operations & Project-Specific Configuration)

Jira Request Process for Central Team Activities

1. Organizational Structure: One GitHub Organization per Product/Application
Best Practice: Ideally, each distinct product or major application should have its own dedicated GitHub Organization.

Why:

Isolation & Clear Ownership: Provides a strong boundary for access control, billing, and auditing specific to a product. It clearly delineates who owns what.

Simplified Access Management: Prevents "sprawl" of teams and users within a single large organization, making it easier to manage permissions for each product.

Billing & Resource Allocation: Facilitates accurate tracking and allocation of GitHub Advanced Security licenses, storage, and other resources per product.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Request Initiation):

Product Team: Identifies the need for a new GitHub Organization for a new product or major application.

Product Team: Creates a Jira request (or similar ticketing system) to the Central GitHub Management Team.

Request Details: Include proposed organization name, primary owner (from product team), and a brief justification.

Central Team Activity (Review & Creation):

Central GitHub Management Team: Reviews the Jira request for adherence to organizational naming conventions and overall strategy.

Central GitHub Management Team: Creates the new GitHub Organization, assigns the requested primary owner, and configures initial global settings (e.g., billing, default visibility, basic security policies).

Product Team Activity (Initial Setup):

Product Team: Takes ownership of the newly created organization.

Product Team: Creates initial teams within their organization (e.g., "Developers," "QA," "Admins") and adds relevant members.

2. Repository Naming Conventions
Best Practice: Implement consistent, descriptive, and easily searchable naming conventions for all repositories within an organization.

Why:

Discoverability & Clarity: Helps teams quickly identify the purpose and ownership of repositories, reducing confusion and improving navigation.

Automation & Scripting: Enables easier scripting and automation of tasks across repositories (e.g., applying security policies, generating reports).

Onboarding: New team members can quickly grasp the repository landscape.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Define & Communicate):

Central GitHub Management Team: Defines and publishes a clear, mandatory repository naming convention (e.g., product-component-type, appname-service-feature).

Example: productA-frontend-web, productA-backend-auth-service, productB-mobile-ios-app.

Central GitHub Management Team: Communicates these guidelines widely to all product teams.

Product Team Activity (Adherence):

Product Team: Adheres to the defined naming conventions when creating new repositories within their organization.

Product Team: For existing repositories, they should plan to refactor names to align with the new convention if feasible and beneficial. (Requires a separate change request if renaming impacts integrations).

3. Branch Protection Rules
Best Practice: Enforce strict branch protection rules on main development branches (e.g., main, develop) to maintain code quality, stability, and security.

Why:

Code Quality: Ensures all code merged into critical branches has been reviewed and approved.

Stability: Prevents direct pushes and unreviewed changes, reducing the risk of breaking builds or introducing bugs.

Security: Mandates checks (e.g., vulnerability scans, static analysis) before code is integrated.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Define Templates & Enable):

Central GitHub Management Team: Defines a set of mandatory and recommended branch protection rule templates.

Mandatory: Require pull request reviews (e.g., 1 or 2 approvals), require status checks to pass before merging, require branches to be up to date before merging, restrict who can push to matching branches, enforce linear history.

Recommended: Require signed commits, include administrators in branch protection.

Central GitHub Management Team: Configures these templates to be automatically applied to new repositories or provides clear instructions for product teams to apply them.

Product Team Activity (Apply & Manage):

Product Team: Applies the mandatory branch protection rules to their main and other critical branches.

Product Team: Configures specific status checks (e.g., CI/CD build success, SonarQube scan, unit test coverage) that must pass for their repositories.

Product Team: Manages the review requirements (number of approvals) based on team size and complexity.

4. Roles and Responsibilities (Access Control)
Best Practice: Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) by assigning the minimum necessary access rights to users and teams. Leverage GitHub's built-in roles effectively.

Why:

Security: Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, accidental data breaches, or malicious activity.

Accountability: Clear roles define who is responsible for what actions.

Operational Efficiency: Prevents confusion and streamlines workflows by limiting options to relevant permissions.

GitHub Roles and Recommended Usage:

Organization Owner:

Description: Has complete administrative control over the organization, including billing, security settings, repository creation/deletion, and user management.

Who: Very limited number of individuals from the Central GitHub Management Team (for global oversight) and a maximum of 1-2 trusted leads from each Product Team (for product-specific organization management).

Repository Admin (via Team):

Description: Can manage repository settings, webhooks, and collaborators, but cannot delete the repository or manage organization-wide settings.

Who: Product Team Leads, DevOps Leads, or senior engineers within a specific product team.

Maintain:

Description: Can manage repository settings, but not sensitive ones like deleting the repository. Can push to protected branches (if allowed by branch protection rules).

Who: Senior developers, tech leads within a product team.

Write:

Description: Can push to non-protected branches, create branches, and manage pull requests.

Who: Most developers within a product team.

Triage:

Description: Can manage issues and pull requests (e.g., assign, label, close) but cannot push code.

Who: QA engineers, project managers, business analysts who need to manage development workflow without direct code access.

Read:

Description: Can view repository content, issues, and pull requests.

Who: Stakeholders, auditors, or external teams who need visibility without contribution rights.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Define & Configure):

Central GitHub Management Team: Defines a standardized matrix of roles and their corresponding permissions across all organizations.

Central GitHub Management Team: Configures default organization-level permissions and ensures primary product team owners are set up correctly.

Product Team Activity (Manage Teams & Members):

Product Team: Creates teams within their product organization (e.g., productA-devs, productA-qa).

Product Team: Assigns appropriate GitHub roles (Admin, Maintain, Write, Triage, Read) to these teams for each repository.

Product Team: Manages the addition and removal of individual members to these teams based on their roles and responsibilities.

Product Team: Regularly reviews team memberships and assigned permissions.

5. Repository Visibility (Public/Private)
Best Practice: Repositories should be private by default. Public visibility requires clear justification and approval.

Why:

Security: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive code, intellectual property, or configuration details.

Intellectual Property Protection: Safeguards proprietary algorithms, business logic, and unique features.

Compliance: Helps meet regulatory requirements for data protection and access control.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Set Defaults & Policy):

Central GitHub Management Team: Sets the default repository visibility to "Private" for all new organizations and repositories.

Central GitHub Management Team: Establishes a formal policy for requesting public repositories, including a review and approval process.

Product Team Activity (Request Changes):

Product Team: Creates all new repositories as private.

Product Team: If a public repository is required (e.g., for open-source contributions, public documentation), they raise a Jira request to the Central GitHub Management Team.

Request Details: Justification for public visibility, type of content, and confirmation that no sensitive information is present.

Central Team Activity (Review & Approval):

Central GitHub Management Team: Reviews the request against the public repository policy, potentially involving security and legal teams.

Central GitHub Management Team: Approves or denies the request and changes the repository visibility if approved.

6. Code Review & Pull Request Strategy
Best Practice: Enforce a mandatory code review process for all code changes via Pull Requests (PRs).

Why:

Quality Assurance: Improves code quality, identifies bugs early, and ensures adherence to coding standards.

Knowledge Sharing: Facilitates knowledge transfer among team members and helps disseminate best practices.

Defect Prevention: Multiple eyes on the code reduce the likelihood of critical defects reaching production.

Implementation Steps:

Product Team Activity (Implement & Educate):

Product Team: Establishes a clear PR workflow (e.g., feature branches, PRs to develop, then merge to main).

Product Team: Educates team members on code review best practices (e.g., constructive feedback, timely reviews, clear PR descriptions).

Product Team: Utilizes GitHub's PR features: assignees, reviewers, labels, and linked issues.

Product Team: Integrates code quality tools (e.g., SonarQube, linters) into CI/CD pipelines, with results displayed in PR checks.

7. Security Best Practices
Best Practice: Proactively leverage GitHub's built-in security features and integrate external security tools.

Why:

Vulnerability Detection: Identifies security flaws and weaknesses in code and dependencies early in the development lifecycle.

Supply Chain Security: Manages and mitigates risks associated with open-source dependencies.

Secret Management: Prevents sensitive credentials from being exposed in code.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Enable & Monitor):

Central GitHub Management Team: Enables GitHub Advanced Security features (Dependabot, Code Scanning, Secret Scanning) at the organization level.

Central GitHub Management Team: Offers guidance and support for integrating GitHub with other CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).

Product Team Activity (Develop & Implement):

Product Team: Develops and implements CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or their chosen CI/CD tool within their repositories.

Product Team: Configures automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) to run on every commit or PR.

Product Team: Sets up automated deployment workflows for various environments (dev, QA, staging, production).

9. Documentation
Best Practice: Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation within each repository and organization.

Why:

Onboarding: Accelerates the onboarding process for new team members.

Maintainability: Ensures that codebases can be easily understood and maintained by current and future teams.

Knowledge Transfer: Prevents knowledge silos and facilitates seamless transitions between projects or personnel.

Implementation Steps:

Product Team: Ensures code is well-commented, especially for complex logic or non-obvious implementations.

Product Team: Regularly reviews and updates documentation as the project evolves.

10. Archiving Strategy
Best Practice: Establish a clear process for archiving inactive or deprecated repositories.

Why:

Clutter Reduction: Improves searchability and reduces noise in active project lists.

Security: Reduces the attack surface by making inactive codebases less accessible.

Compliance: Ensures that old code is retained in a structured manner if required for auditing or historical purposes.

Implementation Steps:

Central Team Activity (Define Policy):

Central GitHub Management Team: Defines an archiving policy, including criteria for archiving (e.g., no activity for X months, project officially decommissioned) and the process for doing so.

Product Team Activity (Initiate & Review):

Product Team: Identifies repositories that meet the archiving criteria.

Product Team: Initiates a Jira request to the Central GitHub Management Team to archive a repository.

Request Details: Repository name, reason for archiving, and confirmation that all necessary backups or historical records have been secured.

Central Team Activity (Execute Archiving):

Central GitHub Management Team: Reviews the request.

Central GitHub Management Team: Archives the repository on GitHub, making it read-only and clearly marked as archived.
